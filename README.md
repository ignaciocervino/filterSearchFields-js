# Filter cars by search fields
This code was developed for training reasons as part of the course 'JavaScript Moderno' on Udemy.
I take the data from a array in the db.js file and filter from different search fields, using a object to save the search parameters.
Adding the Event listeners for each field and calling to 'filtrarAuto()' function where i get and array with the filter of the different parameters
and then displaying them in the 'mostrarAutos' function.
If the user parameters dosnt return any car then i show a error message with the function noResultado()
